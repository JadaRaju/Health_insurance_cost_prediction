# 🏥 **Health Insurance Cost Prediction — ML Project Overview**
🎯 **Business Problem**
The majority of the countries finalize health insurance costs based on many factors such as age, number of people in families, etc. What should be the actual health insurance price for an individual or a family is an issue for many companies. Hence, one insurance company hired you as a data scientist to predict the health insurance cost for possible future customers. They have already collected samples required to perform all data analysis and machine learning tasks. your task is to perform all data analysis steps and finally create a machine learning model which can predict the health insurance cost.

📊 **Dataset Features**
1.age – primary person’s age
2.sex – gender (female/male)
3.bmi – body mass index (kg/m²)
4.children – number of dependents
5.smoker – yes or no
6.region – the beneficiary’s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
7.charges – actual insurance cost (target)

**🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tasks**
1.Checking the data types, shape, and summary statistics of the data
2.Handling missing values and outliers
3.Plotting histograms, boxplots, and density plots to examine the distribution of each variable
4.Plotting scatterplots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps to explore the relationship between variables
5.Engineer and transform features to enhance model performance
